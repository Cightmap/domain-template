<h2 id="understandingtheneedforspeedinverification">Understanding the Need for Speed in Verification</h2>

<p>The digital world operates at lightning speed, demanding instant access and seamless experiences. This expectation necessitates real-time solutions, particularly in online interactions. No one wants to wait days, or even hours, to have their identity verified before accessing an app or bank account.</p>

<p>Delayed verification leads to a frustrating user experience. This could be abandoning online shopping cart because the checkout process becomes overly complicated or difficult to <em>easily prove</em> who you are. Increased cart abandonment directly translates to lost revenue.</p>

<p>The demand for immediate verification isn&#39;t just about user convenience. It has a tangible impact on customer acquisition rates.</p>

<h3 id="therisingthreatofonlinefraud">The Rising Threat of Online Fraud</h3>

<p>While speed is essential, it cannot compromise security. We cannot prioritize rapid processing at the expense of robustly authenticating user validity.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/03/why-online-fraud-attempts-are-up-25percent-in-the-us.html" target="_blank">online fraud attempts</a> have surged dramatically. There was a 25% increase in online fraud attempts in 2021.</p>

<p>This highlights the need for <em>digital verification</em> that balances speed and security to deter scams. The user experience for various sectors, including businesses, banking, cryptocurrency, and consumers, can be greatly enhanced by utilizing security measures such as <em>two-factor authentication</em> or other high-level verification options.</p>

<p id="isPasted">How Real Time Identity Verification Works</p>

<p>How does real time identity verification achieve both speed and security? Instead of time-consuming manual reviews, it <em>verifies identity</em> in seconds using an authentication method to make sure the person matches their credentials. <em>Verification compares</em> submitted data against a set of trusted information.</p>

<p>This method employs several advanced techniques to instantly confirm a user&#39;s claimed identity.</p>

<h3 id="documentverification">Document Verification</h3>

<p>This is a fundamental step in real-time systems. It involves carefully analyzing <em>identity documents</em>, such as driver&#39;s licenses or other forms of ID. The goal is to verify that the document is legitimate and hasn&#39;t been tampered with.</p>

<p>The system performs an in-depth examination of the document. It utilizes advanced algorithms to detect any signs of manipulation or forgery, cross-referencing various data points and security features inherent in official documentation. <em>Verification works</em> by scanning and confirming.</p>

<h3 id="biometricverification">Biometric Verification</h3>

<p>This involves analyzing unique physical characteristics, like facial features or retina patterns. <em>Biometric data</em> offers a highly secure way to verify.</p>

<p>Biometric systems are becoming increasingly sophisticated, convenient, and widely adopted. Many consumers and businesses now use biometric methods, such as facial recognition scans. You can learn more about this <a href="https://plaid.com/resources/identity/digital-identity-verification/#:~:text=Biometric%2Dbased%20identification:%20Biometric%20identification,before%20it%20can%20be%20used." target="_blank">at Plaid</a>.</p>

<h3 id="knowledgebasedauthenticationkba">Knowledge-Based Authentication (KBA)</h3>

<p>KBA adds another layer of security. It involves asking users personalized questions based on pre-selected security settings, with answers that only they would likely know.</p>

<p>These questions are highly specific to the individual. Examples include the location of a special event, a past vehicle model, or the place where they met a loved one.</p>

<h3 id="twofactorauthentication2fa">Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</h3>

<p>This method strengthens the real-time identity verification process with the additional layer of a real-time <em>phone number</em> validation. <em>Verification works</em> by using multiple verification layers. </p>

<p>For example, the <em>user presents</em> an ID and password, followed by a real-time code sent to their registered mobile device, all working in near-instant synchronicity.</p>

<h2 id="benefitsbeyondspeedandsecurity">Benefits Beyond Speed and Security</h2>

<p>Faster validation and enhanced security are undoubtedly primary objectives. But the advantages of real-time processes extend far beyond the immediate surface.</p>

<h3 id="enhancedcustomerexperience">Enhanced Customer Experience</h3>

<p>Consider the delays you&#39;ve encountered during past account setups. Companies are now streamlining their processes, leading to greater user adoption.</p>

<p>A smooth and efficient <em>onboarding process</em> fosters trust and simplifies account creation, even for banking services, as detailed <a href="https://www.lightico.com/blog/how-real-time-photo-id-verification-works/#:~:text=ID%20verification%20is%20a%20process,than%20they%20used%20to%20be" target="_blank">here</a> at Lightico. This positive impact stems from businesses operating in a manner that aligns with user expectations. A good <em>customer experience</em> is a core benefit. </p>

<h3 id="streamlinedoperationsforbusinesses">Streamlined Operations for Businesses</h3>

<p>Real time identity verification doesn&#39;t only benefit end-users. <em>Verification work</em> loads are reduced for employees as well.</p>

<p>Businesses need robust security systems in place. A good <em>verification platform</em> helps businesses achieve a balance between maintaining top-tier security and optimizing customer flow. <em>Complete identity</em> of new customers can help better understand risk. </p>

<p>This enables staff to focus their time and skills on more demanding tasks, rather than repetitive manual <em>verification work</em>. Ultimately, resources can be directed towards enhancing operational quality or pursuing revenue growth, benefiting owners, investors, shareholders, and company leadership.</p>

<h3 id="compliancewithregulations">Compliance with Regulations</h3>

<p>Numerous industries are subject to regulations, laws, and guidelines that require <em>customer identification</em>. Identity verification can simplify compliance with these mandates.</p>

<p>Regulations surrounding verification will continue to evolve to keep pace with the rapid advancements in business. Acceptable identity documents can vary based on jurisdictional standards, industry-specific rules, and legal requirements across different regions worldwide. More information is available <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/knowyourclient.asp" target="_blank">at Investopedia</a>.</p>

<p>Commonly accepted forms of verification include social security cards, driver&#39;s licenses, state-issued ID cards, and other authentic and legitimate identity documents from recognized entities. Businesses can better mitigate <em>fraud risk</em> when running checks. <em>Institutions verify</em> regularly.</p>

<h2 id="realworldapplicationsofrealtimeidentityverification">Real-World Applications of Real Time Identity Verification</h2>
