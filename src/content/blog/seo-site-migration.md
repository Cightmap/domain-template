## SEO Best Practices for Site Migration

A well-defined **SEO migration strategy** preserves rankings, ensures a smooth transition, and boosts search visibility.

### Creating a Redirect Map

Redirects are essential. **301 redirects** guide visitors and search engine crawlers. Conduct a site crawl using **Moz Pro** or **Screaming Frog**.

Prioritize **important URLs** to ensure authority transfer.

| Old URL             | New URL            | Redirect Type |
|---------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| `/old-blog-post`   | `/new-blog-post`  | 301          |
| `/old-product-page` | `/new-product-page` | 301        |

A thorough **redirect plan** prevents traffic loss. Avoid broken pages, which **increase bounce rates** and disrupt SEO.

### Updating Internal Links and Sitemaps

**Internal links** are crucial for site navigation and SEO. Update old links using **Screaming Frog**. Maintain logical **website architecture** for search engines.

**Generate and submit new XML sitemaps** to Google Search Console to help **index pages post-migration**.

### Handling 404s Like a Pro

404 errors happen. **Engaging 404 pages** improve retention. Identify and fix **404s and 410s** before migration using **Majestic or Google Search Console**.

### Mobile Friendliness

Google prioritizes **mobile-first indexing**. Ensure your **responsive design** works across devices.  
Use **Googleâ€™s Mobile-Friendly Test** to check for UX issues.
